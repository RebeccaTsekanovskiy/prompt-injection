README:

This project contains sensitive images users may find offensive. All images are AI-generated and used solely for demonstrating prompt injection and security vulnerabilities in multimodal AI systems.

Disclaimer
This project contains AI-generated images that are intentionally designed to test and demonstrate prompt injection vulnerabilities. Some of these images may depict sensitive or offensive subject matter.
They are not real, nor are they intended to promote harmful content.


The purpose of including these examples is purely research and educational, to highlight how malicious actors might bypass safeguards in multimodal AI systems.

Usage:
- Use this repository only in controlled, academic, or research settings.
- Do not redistribute the images out of context.
- If you are uncomfortable viewing sensitive material, you should avoid opening the /images folder.



Ethical Note:
This work is focused on advancing the understanding of AI safety and security. 
By studying adversarial inputs (including text and images), researchers can better design systems that resist manipulation and protect end-users.
